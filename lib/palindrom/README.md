Part 1) write a program, that accepts a word at the command line and checks, if the entered word can be read forward and backward the same. E.g. "Rotor"

Part 2) extend the program so that it can check a whole sentence - without punctuation, spaces and capitalisation - for the same criteria. E.g.: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
